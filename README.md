# Guess-The-Numer-Game
It's just a game I play with my girl, but she canÂ´t stop cheating and changing the rules, so I made this because Bash never cheats. 

The goal is to guess a 4-digit number between 0000 and 9999 from the other player. You can achieve that with the clues the game gives you after each guess. Every time you introduce a 4-digit number, the program will give you back some information about those numbers. There are only two types of information: well or perfect. Well means that the digit appears in the number your trying to guess, and perfect means that the digit is correct and also in the exact position. With each round, you receive more & more information, is up to you to use it better than your rival.
